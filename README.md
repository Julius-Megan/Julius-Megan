ðŸ‘¯  This is the finished project that I created in that class. It's a simple Calorie Tracker website.
      You can sign up and log in so you can keep track of your daily calories. I am still working on this project.
      The database only includes a few lists of meals that you can copy and add to your own daily log. 


The C++ codes below are from my class projects.
