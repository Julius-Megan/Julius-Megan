### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Julius-Megan/Julius-Megan** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m a senior Computer Science Student. I have completed most of my programming classes including CIS401(Web App Development)
- ğŸ‘¯  This is the finished project that I created in that class. It's a simple Calorie Tracker website.
      You can sign up and log in so you can keep track of your daily calories. I am still working on this project.
      The database only includes a few lists of meals that you can copy and add to your own daily log.
